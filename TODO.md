- get back to the old instance format (three files). [Anna]

- make sure nothing in the instance format is as interpreted as integer
  numbers. [Anna]

- update all the documentation that we
  wrote. [Marco after Anna has done the previous two points]

- resolve incongruencies in preprocessing output: [Marco] eg:

```bash
Instance: 14930 genes, 194 patients, 1413 mutations, 179806 interactions
Preprocessing instance...
before, in component : 14897
degree 1, no cover: 2069
exists better node: 21
no cover, same nbs: 1874
small components:   0
all nodes to remove: 3964
Instance: 0 genes, 0 patients, 0 mutations, 0 interactions
single component
```
